####SMT-based T-Detectability

This extras folder contains two functions and one example, with the following tasks:

1. NUM2STR: is  a generalization of num2str function in Matlab to create negative values as 
they are defined in .smt2 format. It is a perquisite for SMTgen function.
2. SMTgen: Is the main function which receives the system and fault models and generates 
the .smt2 file.
3. SMT_ex: Is an example to show how SMTgen works.
